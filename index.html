    <h2>What made me interested to join the Growth Company?</h2>
    <p>I would like to become a software developer. Ironicly, I do not have a lot of experince working 
        with computers however I really enjoy learning about it. I enjoy problem-solving and learning about
        new things. I was very happy to learn that I was accepted to this bootcamp and I hope I will be able
        to learn a lot about coding.

        <li>I have learnt some basic SQL</li>

    </ul>
